The 'database_initializer.rb' ruby script can be used to set up database objects on your local Oracle XE database(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/express-edition/downloads/index.html).
This is very useful when you want to set up Oracle XE database on your local machine for your development as well as test environment database.
With this utility, you are not required to go to Oracle XE admin panel (e.g. http://localhost:8080/apex) to perform various db tasks. 
We assume that the Oracle XE database admin username/password is set to "system/system".

You can create custom rake tasks to invoke the methods to set up your schema and db objects.
The methods written in the class in effect execute sql files (with valid sql statements) to create following database objects :-
- create/drop schema
- tables
- views
- materialized views
- mv logs
- grants
- synonyms
- database link
- procedure
- sequence
- trigger
- importing database .dmp file
- set up db charset to AL32UTF8

----
Your database.yml file may look like :-
test:
  adapter: oracle_enhanced
  database: XE
  username: myuser
  password: myuser

----  
The methods are self explanatory. We can check whether particular schema or objects exists in the database or not, get and set db charset, etc.

The script requires that your .sql files (e.g.change_db_charset.sql,myuser_xe_setup_create_schema.sql,myuser_xe_setup_DROP_schema.sql) reside
in your {RAILS_ROOT}/db/oracle_xe_setup/ folder.

If you already have database .dmp files from some other database and want to import into your own XE database schema, then you can use :-
task :import_data_into_local_myuser_schema => :environment do
    DatabaseInitializer.import_data_file "myuserdb.dmp", "system", "system", "myuser", true
end

Create schema :-
task :setup_local_myuser_schema => :environment do
    DatabaseInitializer.setup_local_oracle_schema "change_db_charset", "myuser_xe_setup_create_schema"
end

Drop schema :-
task :drop_local_myuser_schema => :environment do
    DatabaseInitializer.drop_local_oracle_schema "myuser_xe_setup_DROP_schema"
end
